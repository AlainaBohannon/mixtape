    <p>lyrics: Ima Lock Out. Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Don’t you go holding the phone when I rock out

    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Rock out talk about what’s hot yeah I’m hot now. Pop out. Hit em’ with a rock
    Bitch I’m hot now. I do shit that I wanna do
    Yo main bitch come through and she got the juice
    Yeah I’m young but I’m looking like a father
    Wrote this shit you could call me a author
    I’m in my bag like a puppy with a white woman
    I don’t go and daze. I just sit back and count money
    I don’t fuck with fake shit. I don’t do the hating. I’m just getting money I ain’t tryna complicate
    If the bitch got some cake you know I had ate
    Put some D up on the plate and now she all on my plate saying pass the Henny
    Shorty wanna buss down man she looking good as fuck she like my bustdown
    You could start calling me busy cuz I’m up now
    MTV come through cuz I’m up now
    All these hoes here I’m finna lock em down
    If a nigga talking shit I’m finna knock em’ down
    Ima Lock Out. Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Don’t you go holding the phone when I rock out
    Talk about all them other hoes that I locked out
    Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Rock out talk about what’s hot yeah I’m hot now. Pop out. Hit em’ with a rock
    Big knots in my pocket take off like a rocket
    Speak on my dick you get hit with this rocket
    Wave shit that’s my shit. Niggas start mosh pit
    I can not slow up I’m flipping bags now
    I’m getting cash now used to be class clown
    Diamonds round my neck you see from a mile
    Yo bitch she ugly she smoke black and milds
    Hold up a while. Who said SB’s went out of style
    When I pull up with gang we a show stopper
    And I’m throwing them hunnids with gang gang
    Smoking gas and then kick shit like Judo
    Not from this world I came out from Pluto
    Origami all these niggas stay folding
    And I flex on a bitch Eddie Guerrero
    I’m a king I’m a pharaoh
    Don’t be throwing no shade a sombrero ya dig
    Ima Lock Out. Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Don’t you go holding the phone when I rock out
    Talk about all them other hoes that I locked out
    Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Rock out talk about what’s hot yeah I’m hot now. Pop out. Hit em’ with a rock
    Ima Lock Out. Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Don’t you go holding the phone when I rock out
    Talk about all them other hoes that I locked out

    <p>Artist: Jadeci </p>
    <p>lyrics: Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
    They just want to put me in the ground to get rid of me
    They just want to copy all my sounds taking it from me
    Demons in my head, I'm on the beat so let me go insane
    They don't want to see what I can do so they go run away
    They just want to put me in the ground to get rid of me
    They just want to copy all my sounds taking it from me
    Demons in my head, I'm on the beat so let me go insane
    They don't want to see what I can do so they go run away
    Decimate, hit his face and make her pay
    Cut the case, get my paper, ándale
    On the way, with your bitch no other way
    Duck away, if you run you're never safe
    Hit em' with the .40 know we flip it like a Tech Deck
    Always carry weight on me like I'm a talking bench press
    Your bitch in love with me got my music in her headset
    When I'm on the beat I'm just a walking, talking death threat
    I'm just a villain and a hero (? I'm the De Niro ?)
    I'm water whipping like a speed boat, no time to reload
    I tell the [?]
    I'm Borderlands just like I'm Zer0 [?]
    They just want to put me in the ground to get rid of me
    They just want to copy all my sounds taking it from me
    Demons in my head, I'm on the beat so let me go insane
    They don't want to see what I can do so they go run away
    They just want to put me in the ground to get rid of me
    They just want to copy all my sounds taking it from me
    Demons in my head, I'm on the beat so let me go insane
    They don't want to see what I can do so they go run away (yeah!)
    <p>Released: 08/23/2019
