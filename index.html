    <p>lyrics: Ima Lock Out. Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Don’t you go holding the phone when I rock out
    Talk about all them other hoes that I locked out
    Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Rock out talk about what’s hot yeah I’m hot now. Pop out. Hit em’ with a rock
    Bitch I’m hot now. I do shit that I wanna do
    Yo main bitch come through and she got the juice
    Yeah I’m young but I’m looking like a father
    Wrote this shit you could call me a author
    I’m in my bag like a puppy with a white woman
    I don’t go and daze. I just sit back and count money
    I don’t fuck with fake shit. I don’t do the hating. I’m just getting money I ain’t tryna complicate
    If the bitch got some cake you know I had ate
    Put some D up on the plate and now she all on my plate saying pass the Henny
    Shorty wanna buss down man she looking good as fuck she like my bustdown
    You could start calling me busy cuz I’m up now
    MTV come through cuz I’m up now
    All these hoes here I’m finna lock em down
    If a nigga talking shit I’m finna knock em’ down
    Ima Lock Out. Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Don’t you go holding the phone when I rock out
    Talk about all them other hoes that I locked out
    Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Rock out talk about what’s hot yeah I’m hot now. Pop out. Hit em’ with a rock
    Big knots in my pocket take off like a rocket
    Speak on my dick you get hit with this rocket
    Wave shit that’s my shit. Niggas start mosh pit
    I can not slow up I’m flipping bags now
    I’m getting cash now used to be class clown
    Diamonds round my neck you see from a mile
    Yo bitch she ugly she smoke black and milds
    Hold up a while. Who said SB’s went out of style
    When I pull up with gang we a show stopper
    And I’m throwing them hunnids with gang gang
    Smoking gas and then kick shit like Judo
    Not from this world I came out from Pluto
    Origami all these niggas stay folding
    And I flex on a bitch Eddie Guerrero
    I’m a king I’m a pharaoh
    Don’t be throwing no shade a sombrero ya dig
    Ima Lock Out. Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Don’t you go holding the phone when I rock out
    Talk about all them other hoes that I locked out
    Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Rock out talk about what’s hot yeah I’m hot now. Pop out. Hit em’ with a rock
    Ima Lock Out. Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Don’t you go holding the phone when I rock out
    Talk about all them other hoes that I locked out
    Ima go low with a foe. Ima pop out
    Men go low to the floor with my Glock out
    Rock out talk about what’s hot yeah I’m hot now. Pop out. Hit em’ with a rock

    <p>What I like about the song: this song slaps so hard. Listen to it in your car and tell me you dont want to go 100mph on the expressway. If you dont then you are lying to yourself.</p>

    Man I dead it soon as it get to my head like a follicle
